Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

1. Use the provided UML to implement the Game class. Use the map to store the
   players and their scores. Every player should start with a score of 0. 
   Calling updateScore will add points to that player's score. Add a main 
   method to test your class.

2. Use the provided UML to implement the Baseball class. The name of a Baseball
   game is always just "baseball". The game always starts at the first inning. 
   The nextInning() method should add one to the current inning. Add a main
   method to test your class.

3. Use the provided UML to implement the Basketball class. The name of a 
   BasketBall game is always just "baskeyball". The game always starts in the 
   first quarter. The nextQuarter() method should add one to the current 
   quarter. The quarter number cannot advance past 4. Add a main method to test
   your class.

5. Bonus (15%) create your own class to represent a different game of your 
   choice. Add a main method to test your class.
