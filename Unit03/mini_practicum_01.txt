Before You Get Started

1. Add the provided junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar file to your
   referenced libraries in the project.

2. Verify that you can run the provided JUnit unit test (JUnitTest) and that
   the test passes. If not, ask for help!

Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

1. Create a Java class to represent a food item. It must meet the following 
   requirements. Be sure to use proper encapsulation!

   a. Food items have a name, grams of fat, and grams of carbohydrates. All 
      three values are provided when a food item is created.
   b. Write accessors for all three values.
   c. Write a method that returns the calories in a food item using the
      forumla: calories = grams of fat * 9 + grams of carbs * 4. For example,
      a food with 10 grams of fat and 20 grams of carbs would be 170 calories
      (9 * 10 + 20 * 4).
   d. Two foods are considered equal if they have the same amount of fat and
      carbs.
   e. The string representation of a food is in the format:
      "<name> {#g fat, #g carbs, # calories}"
      For example: "Twinkie {8g fat, 43g carbs, 244 calories}"

2. Write a JUnit unit test to thoroughly test your food item class.
