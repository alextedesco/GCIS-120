Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

1. Create a new Java class named "Files" and define a static function named
   "countWords" that declares parameters for a filename and a number of 
   letters. Your function should open the file return the count of the words in
   the file with the specified number of letters. Do not worry about digits, 
   punctuation, or special characters; in other words, you may consider 
   "11-point" to be a word with 8 letters. You may assume that there is
   only one word per line in the file. You should rethrow any exceptions that
   occur.
   
2. Define a main method with the appropriate signature and test your function 
   using the "words.txt" file that has been provided to you in the data 
   directory. Print out the count of words containing 1-20 letters (see the 
   output below). You should handle any exceptions that are thrown by printing 
   an error message and exiting gracefully, i.e. your program should not crash.
   When testing your program, refer to the examples below to verify that your
   function is working correctly:

   Letters    Word Count  
   1          27
   2          637
   3          4711
   4          11171
   5          22950
   6          39518
   7          52093
   8          61019
   9          61754
   10         54321
   11         46411
   12         37525
   13         27924
   14         19258
   15         12148
   16         7115
   17         3982
   18         2003
   19         1053
   20         506

3. 25% BONUS: Define a function named "findWords" that declares parameters for 
   a filename and a number of letters. Return a String array containing all of 
   the words in the file with the specified number of letters. You may rethrow
   any exceptions that occur. Your method should work for any number of 
   letters, but test it from main by finding and printing all of the words that
   have 27 letters (there are 3 of them).
