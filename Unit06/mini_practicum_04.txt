Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

1. Consider that a divisor of an integer n is any value 1 <= i <= n such that n
   is evenly divisible by i. For example, the divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 
   16, 32, and 64.

   You have been provided with a partially completed Java program in a class
   named "Divisors" and a JUnit unit test named "DivisorsTest". Use RECURSION
   to complete the private divisors function so that it returns all of the 
   divisors for an integer value n as a string. For example, if n=64, your 
   recursive function should return the string "1 2 4 8 16 32 64".

   Use the tests in the provided JUnit unit test to verify that your function 
   is working correctly. It is recommended that you uncomment the tests one at
   a time, from top to bottom. Once you get each test passing, move on to the
   next test. It is NOT recommended that you try to get all of the tests to 
   pass at once. You may add additional tests if you would like to do so.

   You may also use the main method in the Divosors class to test your code by
   hand, though you will still need to get the provided tests to pass for full
   credit.

   If you hard code your solution, you will not receive credit. If you do not 
   use recursion in your solution, you will not receive credit.
