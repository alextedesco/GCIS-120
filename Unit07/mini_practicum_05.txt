Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

0. A JUnit test has been provided to you so that you can test your code as you
   implement it. All but the first test has been commented out. It is STRONGLY
   recommended that you uncomment the tests one at a time and write the code
   necessary to get each to pass before moving on to the next test. Open the 
   test now and verify that you can run it.
   
   DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTS.

1. Define a new Java class in a file called "MiniPracticum5" and define a new 
   static function named "reverse" that declares a parameter for a String. 
   Choose one of the data structures that have been provided to you (NodeQueue 
   or NodeStack) and use it to create a copy of the original string with the 
   characters in reverse order. You MUST use the data structure in some 
   significant way. If you do not, you will not receive credit for this problem.

2. In the same class, define a new static function named "noOdds" that declares
   a parameter for an int array. Choose one of the data structures that have
   been provided to you and use it to return a copy of the array with all of 
   the odd values removed. The remaining values must be in the original order 
   in the copy that is returned. You MUST use the data structure in some 
   significant way. If you do not, you will not receive credit for this problem.
