Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

0. A JUnit test has been provided to you so that you can test your code as you
   implement it. All but the first test has been commented out. It is STRONGLY
   recommended that you uncomment the tests one at a time and write the code
   necessary to get each to pass before moving on to the next test. Open the 
   test now and verify that you can run it.
   
   DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTS.

   To receive full credit for your solutions to these problems, you must make
   effective use of built-in data structures to implement an efficient 
   solution. If you solve the problem inefficiently, you will still receive 
   some credit.

1. Create a new Java class named "Practicum06" and define a static method named
   "arrayToList" that declares a parameter for an int array. Copy the array 
   into a new ArrayList and return it.

2. Define a static method named "uniqueValues" that declares a parameter for an
   ArrayList of integers and returns copy of the list containing all of the 
   unique values from the original list. For example, given the list 
   [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] you would return a list containing only 
   [1, 2, 3, 4]. The order of the values in the list does not matter.

3. BONUS (10%) Define a static method named "characterCount" that declares a 
   parameter for a string and returns a map containing the count of how many 
   times each character appears in the string. For example, given the string 
   "Hello, World!" the map returned would include the following values:
   'H' : 1
   'e' : 1
   'l' : 3
   'o' : 2
   ',' : 1
   ' ' : 1
   'W' : 1
   'r' : 1
   'd' : 1
   '!' : 1
