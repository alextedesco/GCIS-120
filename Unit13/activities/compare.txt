Which interface must be implemented in order to define the natural ordering of the
instances of a class?
    Comparable

Let A and B be two instances of a class that implements the interface above. Write the
method call used to make a comparison between A and B.
    A.compareTo (B)

What value might be returned if A comes before B in the natural order?
Which interface must be implemented to define an alternate ordering for some class
(e.g. if there is no natural order or the natural order doesnâ€™t work)?
    Comparator

Let class C be a class that implements the above interface. Show the method call used
to make a comparison between A and B.
    C.compare (A, B)

What value might be returned if A comes after B?
    int > 0
