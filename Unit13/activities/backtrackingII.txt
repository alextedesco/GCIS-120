Solve the box packing problem using these questions:

1.) List the fields that would be included in the state of your Configuration?
- List of packed boxes with pack location (top-left corner).
- List of unpacked boxes

2.) How would you create successor configurations?
Create one configuration for each unpacked box, packing it into the next available
spot to the left. If there is no spot to the left, try placing it above

3.) What would be a good pruning strategy?
- If the configuration has a total height > 3, it is invalid.
- If the configuration has a total width > 7, it is invalid.

4.) How would you know that a Configuration is the goal?
- The unpacked list is empty.
