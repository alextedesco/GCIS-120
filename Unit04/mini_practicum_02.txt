Before You Get Started

1. Add the provided junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar file to your
   referenced libraries in the project.

2. Verify that you can run the provided JUnit unit test (JUnitTest) and that
   the test passes. If not, ask for help!

Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

1. Create a new Java class named ArrayUtils and define a method named 
   "arrayCopy" that declares a parameter for an int array. Use a while loop to
   make a copy of the array and return it. The original array must not be 
   modified in any way. Your method should work for arrays of any size 
   (including 0).

2. Define a new method in the ArrayUtils class named "arrayReverse" that 
   defines a parameter for an int array. Use a for loop to make a copy of the
   array with the elements in reverse order. In other words, given the array
   {1, 2, 3, 4} your function would return {4, 3, 2, 1}. The original array 
   should not be modified in any way.

2. Write a JUnit unit test to thoroughly test both of your array functions.
