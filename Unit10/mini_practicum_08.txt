Practicum Instructions

You have 30 minutes to complete this mini-practicum. Each question is equally
weighted. Raise your hand if you need help.

You WILL NOT need to write JUnit tests for this practicum. The JUnit library
has been provided to you for use in the remainder of this unit.

Use the provided UML to implement a class hierarchy that includes interfaces
and abstract classes. Define a main method in each of your classes that tests 
the class. All distances are in miles. Your solution must meet the following 
requirements:

1. A person burns 100 calories per mile moved. There are 3500 calories in one
   pound, and so their weight should be reduced accordingly.

2. Cars that are manual get 35 mpg. Cars that are not get 30 mpg.

3. Motorcycles without sidecars get 60 mpg. If a sidecar is attached, they get 
   45 mpg.
